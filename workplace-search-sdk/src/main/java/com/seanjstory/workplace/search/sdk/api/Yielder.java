/**
 * Abstract class from which all yielders extend.
 * 
 * When a sub-class implements the yieldNextCore method,
 * during runtime it will be enhanced to the following:
 * 
 * 1. All local variables within the yieldNextCore method
 * will be promoted to class member fields.
 * 2. A new member, "state" of type byte, will be added.
 * 3. Each call to yieldReturn will have the following code
 * appended to after it:
 * <code>
 * state = [number];
 * return;
 * Label[number]:
 * </code>
 * 4. Each call to yieldBreak will have a <code>return</code>
 * statement appended to it.
 * 5. At the beginning of the method, a switch will be added
 * containing a number of case branches equal to the number
 * of yieldReturn calls, such as the following code:
 * <code>
 * switch (state) {
 * case [number]: goto Label[number];
 * ..
 * }
 * </code>
